# ToDo App
Create an offline TODO App for the browser using React JS.

## Features
+ A simple input bar to add Todo(s) on pressing the return key.
+ A list of TODO cards where each todo is appended on creation.
+ Clicking on a TODO card marks the TODO as complete and move it to the
bottom of the list.
+ The active TODO cards appear in order of creation (most recent on top), while
the completed todo cards appear in order of completion (most recent on top).
+ A reset button on the top right corner of the App to clear all Todo(s) and return to the
initial state.
+ Hitting the refresh button (including hard refresh) in the browser does not cause
any change in the state of the app (it should work like a regular offline app), the offline feature is implement using Local Storage.
